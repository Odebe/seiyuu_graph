The nickname sticks so well that she is called Osaka by teachers and even in the class roster, to the point that no one remembers her real name.

An old high school friend and rival of Yukari, they have a juvenile, exasperating, but funny relationship with each other; Yukari relentlessly insults and freeloads from Nyamo, but Nyamo gets her digs in, too. \"Nyamo\" is a nickname from her student days, but Yukari calls her that, and so does Tomo. Other students call her Kurosawa-sensei. Whereas Yukari appears to be an older version of Tomo, Nyamo resembles Yomi (more in personality than looks) and the two teachers' odd relationship is similar to the one that Tomo and Yomi share.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nPopular with the students, Nyamo is nicer, less obnoxious, and far more in control than Yukari. Yukari often teases her about her past romantic relationships and that she is a \"stupid P.E. teacher.\" During one of the summer trips the girls take together, Nyamo gets very drunk (usually, Yukari is prone to this behaviour; as a matter of fact, Nyamo drank specifically to keep the alcohol away from Yukari) and tells the girls all about the birds and the bees, which embarrasses Sakaki and confuses Chiyo, but impresses the other girls.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIn addition to teaching her homeroom class and P.E., Nyamo is the coach/advisor of the women's swim team.

She also owns and drives a blue Toyota Vitz 5-door. She is very sensitive to comments about her love life, which has evidently provided Yukari with an endless supply of blackmail material and points at which to rib her. One of these apparently involves a \"love letter\" from high school, which Yukari loves to dangle over her head.

Such grade-skipping would be unthinkable in Japan, and the series humorously explores its potential consequences. The other characters find Chiyo amazingly cute, but sometimes take advantage of both her youthfulness and her scholastic abilities. Her diminutive stature leads to her having a lack of confidence, particularly in sports where she fears she is a burden to others. Chiyo is frequently viewed with jealousy by fellow students, initially because of her intelligence, but later also because of the discovery that her family is exceedingly wealthy (they own an enormous mansion and a summer house which Chiyo invites her classmates to visit on several occasions). The stylistic rendering of Chiyo's pigtails allow for several visual gags in both the manga and anime: Osaka often imagines them to be flapping wings, or as entities independent of Chiyo herself. At home, she can almost always be found in the company of her enormous dog, Tadakichi-san.

She can never seem to stick to these diets however, as she finds herself constantly tempted by her favorite foods. Another weakness of Yomi's character is that while she is above average in everything else, Yomi is an awful singer, but karaoke is one of her favorite pastimes. While usually functioning as Tomo's \"straight man\", she sometimes manifests a rather cruel sense of humor. Yomi also has an uppercut that Tomo is usually on the receiving end of whenever she pushes Yomi too far. However, even though she likes to think that she is well above the childish behavior of some of her classmates, Yomi has demonstrated in the story that she can be just like the rest of the characters on certain occasions, such as trying to get Chiyo to infuse a shrine charm with some of her intelligence so that she could pass her college entrance exams.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"id":180,"name":"Sakaki","image":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/14/56155.jpg","japanese":"榊","fullname":" Sakaki","seyu":[{"id":119,"name":"Yuu Asakawa","image":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/54912.jpg","japanese":"浅川 悠","website":"https://ameblo.jp/tacit","birthday":"1975-03-20"},{"id":509,"name":"Christine Auten","image":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/23505.jpg","japanese":"","website":"http://","birthday":"1969-05-07"},{"id":8177,"name":"Samia Little Elk","image":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/5410.jpg","japanese":"","website":"http://","birthday":null},{"id":14837,"name":"Myeong Seon Lee","image":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/15409.jpg","japanese":"이 명선","website":"http://","birthday":null}],"synopsis":"Height: 174 cm\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSakaki is a quiet, stylish girl.

It is Kaori's great tragedy she is often too abashed merely by the sight of Sakaki to cultivate more of a relationship with the enigmatic object of her affections, but chance does throw the two of them into shared situations now and again.  At these times Kaori can be quite forward in her own way, especially when it comes to fending off any \"threats\" to her time spent with her heart's desire.  Kaori's high school career becomes much more trying in its latter days when her new homeroom teacher declares his undying affection for young \"Kaorin.\"  Horrors!"},{"id":563,"name":"Kimura","image":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/75243.jpg","japanese":"木村先生","fullname":"Kimura \"Kimurin\" ","seyu":[{"id":45,"name":"Kouji Ishii","image":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/35883.jpg","japanese":"石井 康嗣","website":"http://www.vi-vo.jp/member-kojiishii","birthday":"1960-07-01"},{"id":153,"name":"Andy McAvin","image":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/275.jpg","japanese":"","website":"http://www.pastorini-bosbytalent.com/","birthday":"1952-01-04"},{"id":14855,"name":"Ju Chang Lee","image":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/15447.jpg","japanese":"이 주창","website":"http://","birthday":"1969-01-15"},{"id":19936,"name":"Thomas Petruo","image":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/22660.jpg","japanese":"","website":"http://www.petruo.de/","birthday":"1956-10-10"}],"synopsis":"The only male teacher seen regularly in the series, Kimura\u0026#039;s open-mouthed expression (as well as his ability to simply appear out of nowhere) tends to creep out most of the female students. While he has shown tendencies to be responsible and kind-hearted (he recycles littered cans, donates frequently to charities and even offered 10,000 yen as an offering at a Shinto shrine to pray for world peace), he openly enjoys looking at girls wearing bloomers sports gear and swimsuits (he even so much as admitted that he became a teacher because he liked looking at schoolgirls). Obviously, the girls find this perverted, but it also creates empathy with the male students, most of whom would like to do the same thing.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cdiv class=\"spoiler\"\u003e\n\u003cinput type=\"button\" class=\"button show_button\" onclick=\"this.nextSibling.style.display='inline-block';this.style.display='none';\" data-showname=\"Show spoiler\" data-hidename=\"Hide spoiler\" value=\"Show spoiler\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"spoiler_content\" style=\"display:none\"\u003e\u003cinput type=\"button\" class=\"button hide_button\" onclick=\"this.parentNode.style.display='none';this.parentNode.parentNode.childNodes[0].style.display='inline-block';\" value=\"Hide spoiler\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe is married to a pretty and kind young woman and has a (normal) young daughter, much to everyone\u0026#039;s surprise.\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"},{"id":17864,"name":"Kimura's Wife","image":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/67776.jpg","japanese":"木村の妻","fullname":"Kimura's Wife ","seyu":[{"id":92,"name":"Sayaka Ohara","image":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/54698.jpg","japanese":"大原 さやか","website":"http://www.sayaka-ohara.jp","birthday":"1975-12-06"},{"id":6435,"name":"Kaytha Coker","image":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/11595.jpg","japanese":"","website":"http://","birthday":null},{"id":14927,"name":"Seon Hye Kim","image":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/15627.jpg","japanese":"김 선혜","website":"http://","birthday":"1974-08-18"},{"id":33579,"name":"Carmen Katt","image":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/34481.jpg","japanese":"","website":"http://","birthday":"1975-01-01"}],"synopsis":"The Wife of Teacher Kimura.
