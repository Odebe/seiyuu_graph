Meanwhile, on the other side of the galaxy, Yang—a strong supporter of democratic ideals—has to stand firm in his beliefs, despite the struggles of the FPA, and show his pupil, Julian Mintz, that autocracy is not the solution.\r\n\r\nAs ideologies clash amidst the war's many casualties, the two strategic masterminds must ask themselves what the real reason behind their battle is.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Reinhard's family had just moved in the house next door, after introducing themselves to each other, Reinhard declared that Siegfried was a very common name and from then on he would call him Kircheis which sounded better, the two immediately stroke up a friendship that was to last for life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the emperor took Reinhard's sister to be his concubine, Annerose asked Kircheis, who had an innocent crush on her, to promise that he will always be by her brother's side. Kircheis kept his promise, he followed Reinhard in the military and together they rose through the ranks facing many trials, eventually Reinhard was made a count and was awarded the command of a fleet, opening their road to power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKircheis is an excellent tactician, often able to discern and even predict Reinhard's elaborate battle plans. A kind person and a dedicated friend to Reinhard, he is always by his side, and goes on the fight alongside him in his red colored battleship Barbarossa. He often acts as a restraint for Reinhard's ambition as well as his wrath when his arrogance gets the better of him. He believes both in Reinhard's abilities and the righteousness of his intentions and his only goal is to help Reinhard fulfill his destiny."

He first met Reuenthal while stationed in fortress Iserlohn, early in his career, and the two became close friends. Kind and caring, Mittermeyer has been a stabilizing factor for Reuenthal's self-destructive tendencies ever since. A family man at heart Mittermeyer soon married his childhood sweetheart Evangeline and became a dedicated husband, but their efforts to have children have been fruitless thus far. Unfortunately for him, his lowly pedigree was about to cause him serious trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMittermeyer ordered the execution of one of his subordinates for assaulting, robbing and murdering a civilian woman. Although his decision was just, he turned out to belong to a powerful noble family and Mittermeyer was soon arrested. While the nobles plotted his death, desperate to save his only friend Reuenthal met with Reinhard von Müsel (later Lohengramm) and offered his and Mittermeyer's loyalty to him, in exchange for aid in saving Mittermeyer from the nobility and clearing his name. Reinhard, who had his own well-known issues with the nobles, readily accepted and both of them were transferred under his command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicknamed \"the gale wolf,\" Mittermeyer is renowned for his boldness in warfare, his lightning responses to changing factors in the battlefield, as well as his ability to cover huge distances in a relatively short time, while keeping his fleet organized from his flagship Beowulf. Under Reinhard's command, he receives the flagship Beowulf. Mittermeyer is an able strategist and a brilliant tactician, one of the very best of his era. He is composed, just with his subordinates and fiercely loyal to Reinhard, not only for saving his life, but also because he honestly respects his abilities."

(776 U.C.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCount Reinhard von Lohengramm is a young admiral in the Galactic Empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was born Reinhard von Müsel to an impoverished aristocratic family. His mother died when he was very young and he only has faint memories of her. His father's will was shattered at about the same time and the only person left to care for young Reinhard was his beloved older sister Annerose. When Reinhard was about ten years old, his family had to move into a middle class suburban neighborhood. There he met Siegfried Kircheis who would become his best and perhaps only friend, but whatever happiness Reinhard managed to find as a child was to be short-lived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe emperor Friedrich IV took a liking to his sister and ordered her to move into his palace and become his new concubine. Afraid that if she refused she would bring down the emperor's wrath on her younger brother, Annerose reluctantly accepted and her father even managed to get some money out of it. Infuriated Reinhard swore vengeance against the emperor, vengeance against the Goldenbaum dynasty and vengeance against the oppressive nobility. He swore that he would never rest until he freed his sister of her predicament and became powerful enough never to be ordered by anyone again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo achieve his goals and with Kircheis by his side, Reinhard joined the military. He quickly rose through the ranks and after proving his ability time and again to the hostile and corrupt nobility, ever reluctant to accept a fallen aristocrat like him into their ranks, he became an imperial high admiral and was elevated to peerage as the \"count of Lohengramm\". As he steps into the admiralty, the Emperor gives him the prototype battleship Brünhild, which serves as Reinhards flagship from then on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicknamed \"Blonde Brat\" by his enemies and \"Golden Lion\" by his friends, Reinhard is a handsome and gifted individual, a superb tactician and an unequaled strategist. Brave and noble, he always leads his fleets from the front, much to the admiration, as well as the horror, of his subordinates. Ambitious and determined, Reinhard is only hindered by his immeasurable pride, his warlike nature and the turmoil in his heart."

From an early age, she was distinguished from the other girls of the aristocrat society by her independent ideas. Completely unconcerned, Hilda pursued her own interests in reading, politics and history. Her mother having died when Hilda was young, her open-minded father respected Hilda's unique ideas and choices in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn U.C. 797, the old galactic empire spilt into civil war, where the old nobility stood against the new emerging camp of military elites lead by Reinhard von Lohengramm. Hilda convinced her father to plea allegiance to the latter, whereupon she met Reinhard for the first time and impressed him with the clarity of her insight. When the Lohengramm camp emerged victorious from the civil war, Reinhard gained complete political and military power in the empire, and Hilda became Reinhard's chief secretary and assisted him in the progressive reforms that swept across the empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom U.C. 798 to U.C. 800, Hilda played an active role on the galactic stage, advising Reinhard wisely on imperial policies and tactics, and became one of his most valued and trusted staff.

General Mittermeyer later praised Hilda that \"her intelligence is worth more than a fleet.\" Her role gradually became more public after Reinhard's coronation as the first Emperor of the new Lohengramm Dynasty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the year U.C. 800, in the Ninth Battle of Iserlohn, Hilda succeeded General Steinmetz to become the Fleet's Chief Advisor, formally capable of representing the Emperor and command on his behalf on the battlefield. Conscious of her military position, Hilda withheld her political role and refused to advise Reinhard on political matters, despite his repeated requests for her counsel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn August of U.C. 800, Reinhard was attacked by an assassin who sought vengeance for Reinhard's inaction in the Westland tragedy. Overcame with regret and emotional agony, Reinhard withdrew into his own quarters and Hilda entered to console him. Subconsciously realizing that his reliance on her has deepened past their professional relationship, he asked her to stay, and she agreed, determined to help him to the best of her abilities. The morning after, Reinhard came to Hilda's home and proposed marriage, and Hilda did not immediately reply for the uncertainty whether she can truly give him happiness. She also did not reveal her pregnancy to him until after the Urvashi affair and Reuentahl's subsequent rebellion, which deepened the insight of both Hilda and Reinhard toward their own feelings. When peace was restored, Hilda accepted Reinhard's second proposal, and they were married on January 19, U.C. 801. The officials of the empire greeted their new Empress with enthusiasm and joy. On May the 14th, while Reinhard was away at war, Hilda give birth to a son, whom Reinhard named Alexander Siegfried von Lohengramm. Reinhard's illness seriously exacerbated a mere sixteen days later and was diagnosed with a rare form mutative connective tissue disease, with no know cure. Despite the illness, Reinhard decided to return to the imperial capital for the sake of the people awaiting him there. On July the 18th, Reinhard and Hilda were re-united. On July the 26th, the dying Reinhard said his final words to Hilda: \"My Empress, you shall rule the universe more wisely than I. If you think setting up a constitution is the better way then so be it. The universe would be fine as long as the strongest and wisest among all the living governs it. If Alexander Seigfried lacks that ability, there is no need for Lohengramm dynasty to continue. Do everything as you wish; that is my greatest wish...\" He died at the age of twenty-five, with their son succeeding him and Hilda ruling as the Empress dowager. She was remembered by later historians as the person who nurtured the Lohengramm Empire to maturity.</span>\n</div>"

He has nothing but contempt for his incompetent commander and despises the high nobles, realizing fully well the decadence of the Goldenbaum dynasty and how ignorant they are of the common people's plight. If he himself had been born a few years earlier, when the \"inferior genes exclusion law\" was still in effect, he would have been discarded as dangerous to the species. Because of that and realizing Reinhard's abilities, he wants to join his camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOberstein is a genius strategist and organizer, both in war and politics. Calm and composed, he never shows any sign of emotional distress, everything he says and does is part of a well thought, reasonable plan."

(767 U.C.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOskar von Reuenthal is a rear admiral serving in Reinhard's fleet and, along with Wolfgang Mittermeyer, Reinhard's ablest field commander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReuenthal was born to a lowly, but rich noble father and a mother from a distinguished but impoverished line that only married his father for his material affluence. Reuenthal was born with a rare condition called heterochromia, one of his eyes is blue, while the other is brown. Since both his parents had blue eyes, this was seen as proof of his mother's adultery. His mother committed suicide after trying to pluck out his brown eye while he was still an infant. Reuenthal's father put the blame on him and he grew up hated and neglected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReuenthal joined the military and rose through the ranks rather quickly, finding in war the reason he needed to keep on living. While stationed in fortress Iserlohn, he met Wolfgang Mittermeyer and the two became close friends. Mittermeyer is probably the only person Reuenthal has managed to have a normal relationship with and he greatly values their friendship. When Mittermeyer was unjustly detained and in danger of assassination by the nobility, Reuenthal didn't hesitate to pledge his loyalty to Reinhard in return for his help with Mittermeyer's case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReuenthal appears calm and composed on the outside, he is a brilliant war strategist, second only to Reinhard, and an accomplished tactician, but Reuenthal is, in reality, a ticking bomb ready to go off at any moment and perhaps would have already exploded if not for Mittermeyer's soothing presence in his life. His problematic childhood has ridden him with an incredible amount of self-loathing and a complete inability to trust women, though handsome and successful with the opposite sex, he never manages to get into a healthy relationship. Proud and ambitious Reuenthal often contemplates treachery, but his respect towards Reinhard and the debt he owes him, manage to restrain him. His flagship is the Tristan."

He barely made it through the officer's academy due to his lack of interest, though he did make a number of friends there including Dusty Attenborough and Jean Robert Lap. He also met music student Jessica Edwards and both him and Lap developed a crush on her, Jessica eventually chose Lap, Yang accepted her decision and they remained friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after he graduated, Yang became involved in a battle near the friendly planet El Facil, because of his superiors' incompetence and cowardice, the planet was abandoned while a hostile imperial fleet was on its way. Yang was one of the few officers that remained behind and tried to help the population, thanks to his efforts the planet was evacuated in time. Because of this achievement he became famous as \"the hero of El Facil\" and \"miracle Yang,\" forever earning the envy of his peers and the scorn of his superiors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was at El Facil that Yang first became interested in tactics, but ever since that incident and although he kept rising through the ranks, his novel tactical suggestions were being arbitrarily rejected by hostile superiors. Though disappointed and increasingly cynical with the state of affairs in the Alliance, Yang never stopped trying to do at least the absolute minimum to justify his salary and the pension he was so looking forward to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiracle Yang, also called \"the magician,\" is a genius tactician, as well as a competent strategist. Unlike his often proud adversaries, Yang is more than willing to resort to trickery and his only flaw as a commander lies with his inability to go against the orders of his superiors. Yang holds democracy in an extremely high esteem and has a well-defined political philosophy, providing much insight to anyone willing to listen to him. In his personal life he appears to be quite slothful, he is notoriously incompetent with house chores, as well as in all things romantic. After serving on the Patorokolos in the start of the series, Yang eventually gets the battleship Hyperion as he his given command of the 13th fleet, and this becomes his flagship during the coming conflic\u00adts."

As he had carried out this plot without the approval of Braunschweig, who had scorned his advice, Ferner could not and would not return to the Prince's side. Acknowledging Reinhard's superiority, he instead opted to turn himself in to the Lohengramm forces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an audience with Reinhard, he immediately expressed his wish to serve him, saying that Braunschweig did not appreciate his subordinates enough to ensure their loyalty. Perhaps because of his similarity to the intelligent but blunt Chief of Staff, Reinhard placed Ferner under the command of Paul von Oberstein. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the series, Ferner often attempts to analyze Oberstein's plans and motivations. By virtue of his keen investigative skills and occasionally “unerring” judgment, he also proves to be a valuable asset to Oberstein and the Ministry of Military Affairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerner is subsequently promoted to the rank of Commodore, then Rear Admiral. He is also made Investigative Department Chief and later Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Military Affairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Sources: LOGH episodes 18, 20, 58, 75, 85, 105]"

                "synopsis": "Dwight Greenhill was the Chief of Staff to the Space Fleet Commander, later to the Headquarters Commander, and finally the Alliance Investigation Chief of the Free Planets Star Fleet\u00ad\u00ad. He was the father of Frederica Greenhill. An highly respected officer, he was one of the few military leaders to recognize Yang Wen-li's talent.<br>\r\nAfter the failed Alliance invasion of the Empire and the losses at the Battle of Amritsar, many in the military, including Greenhill, were disgruntled by the civilian leadership. Their disenchantment united with encouragement from former POW Arthur Lynch. Greenhill was a longtime friend of Lynch, and so was partial to Lynch's opinions despite Lynch's failings at El Facil. Greenhill formed the National Salvation Military Council (NSMC) to overthrow the civilian government, and enacted martial law.<br>\r\nAlthough he participated in the coup, Greenhill did have personal doubts about his cause, and one of his reasons for betraying the government was so that he could control the other members of the coup and prevent as much bloodshed as possible. Throughout the crisis, Greenhill tried to moderate the actions of his subordinates, often unsuccessfully.<br>\r\nHis coup took early success, gaining over half of the Alliance's surviving forces. However, his coup crumbled because of incompetence and Yang Wen-li's resistance. His plan to assassinate Yang Wen-li not only failed, but the assassin, Commander Bagdashu, publicly announced that the coup was a subversion by Reinhard von Lohengramm, though Yang did not have solid proof of this. This, combined with the massacre of protestors at a rally, destroyed the council's public relations. After the defeat of the 11th Fleet at the Battle of Doria most of the remaining neutral or NSMC Alliance military forces defected to Yang Wen Li's side, leaving the council stranded on Heinessen. Greenhill was ready to admit defeat when Yang Wen-li destroyed the Artemis Necklace. When given the option of using the people of Heinessen as hostages Greenhill, in horror and disgust, refused to do so, preferring to let the nation heal from the civil war as quickly as possible. Intending to take his own life, Greenhill then confronted Lynch. Lynch, having confessed that he had instigated the coup under Duke Lohengramm's orders, then killed Greenhill in a shootout between the two men.<br>\r\nTragically, Greenhill's coup d'état would bring about the opposite of what he sought to do. Not only did the corrupt government remain in power and the Alliance lose another of its remaining fleets, but the actions of the renegade military units completely turned public opinion against the military, destroying the last of its independence from political control. Far from reviving a weakened Alliance, Greenhill and his group only served to weaken it even further, a situation which would directly lead to its demise only a few years later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Source: Gineipaedia)"

That Stokes' forces continued forward for quite some time was presumably due to the sudden loss of communications.<br>\r\nEventually realizing the situation, Stokes turned to aid Legrage, but Attemborough's forces attacked fiercely, convincing him to turn and engage the smaller force first. Unknown to Stokes, he played right into Yang's hands. Attemborough mostly stayed just out of reach, only attacking when Stokes would begin to turn back towards the main battle. This way, Stokes was kept away from Legrange, who was defeated.<br>\r\nEventually, the rest of Yang's forces joined Attemborough's squadron, critically outgunning and outnumbering Stokes's forces. Despite Yang's repeated offers of surrender, Stokes refused to relent, and was lost with the rest of the 11th Fleet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Source: Gineipaedia)"
